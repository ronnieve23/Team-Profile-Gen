# Team-Profile-Gen  ![MIT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This Repository contains code for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Challenge 10 "Object Oriented Programming - Team Profile Generator". 

For this This week's challenge, we were tasked to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an html webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The app utilizes Node.js , Inquirer package, Inquirer-Recursive, and Jest(for testing).

## Installation
1. Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Clone the repository OR download the code from https://github.com/ronnieve23/Team-Profile-Gen

3. Navigate to where you saved the downloaded/cloned repository; Right click on the repostiory folder (Team-Profile-Gen) and select "New Terminal at folder". *(see installation notes)*

4. Inside the terminal, type "npm i" and hit enter. Wait for the installation to finish.

5. Type "node index.js" and hit enter. You will be asked to answer a series of prompts; each answer will go towards your generated HTML file! You should see the message "HTML Generated" after all the prompts are answered.

6. Close the terminal and open your Team-Profile-Gen folder. From there, open the "dist" folder and you can find your newly generated HTML file inside! You can open this file  directly to your browser,inside VS Code, or any code editor that you prefer.

#### Installation Notes:
 1. If you have a windows machine, you can download and use "GitBash" to simulate usage of the MacOS terminal.

 2. An alternative to the steps above is to open your downloaded/cloned repository inside VS Code right away and launch the terminal from inside VS Code. Use this option if you would want to fiddle with the code and change the layout of generated HTML. The generated HTML would still be under the 'dist' folder.
